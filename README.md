You can view a very simple working example [here](http://peaceful-citadel-7847.herokuapp.com/) (only 3 questions).

### To Do:
- Improve overall design
- Refactor code within socket.on("answer")
- Pull questions from MongoDB using Mongoose
- Utilize [200,000+ historical Jeopardy questions](http://usareddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/)
- Use the [Web Speech API](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API) to handle spoken answers
